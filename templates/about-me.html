            I weighed up how I'd like to work, which is in a skill based position where I'm able to continuously develop and am likely to be rewarded for it. I considered what I find engaging; I've spent my life on
            computers dipping into professional software like Photoshop and Illustrator, thoroughly learning music production programs starting with Fruity Loops before continuing with Ableton Live for the past 7 years,
            and occasionally dabbling in the video editing software Adobe Premiere primarily for my media studies A-level and then more recently making videos for friends and family birthdays. Two work related benefits
            I've taken from these hobbies are a familiarity with how professional software tends to function at the user experience level and a knack for independent learning, troubleshooting and problem solving. I also 
            wanted to be sure my chosen career would be somewhat future-proof as I am going to dedicate my future to developing this skill set.

                My first instinct was to study for a qualification alongside my job, but then I spoke to a contact with a background in the industry. A few weeks later he got in touch and asked me to work for him developing
                an app. Of course I jumped at the opporunity.

            <p class="lead">
                The upsides have been tremendous; I was able to dedicate all of my working hours to developing an app single-handedly from start to finish, which has allowed me to test and play and develop my 
                skills independently. I've worked through every problem to its solution and understand how each component fits into the app as a whole.
